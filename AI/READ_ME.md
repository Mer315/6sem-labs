### LIST OF PROGRAMS
## CYCLE 1:
1. Create a program to implement linear regression.
2. Implement a decision tree classifier for a basic classification problem.
3. Implement the Breadth-First Traversal algorithm on a given graph.
4. Write a program for Depth-First Traversal in a graph.
5. Develop a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game. Allow users to make moves on a 3x3 grid, and implement
the logic to determine the winner or declare a draw.
6. Implement the search algorithm to solve the 8-Puzzle problem.

## CYCLE 2:
7. Solve the classic Water-Jug Problem using a search algorithm. Given two jugs with
different capacities, determine the sequence of actions needed to measure a specific
quantity of water
8. Design a program to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem using a suitable algorithm.
9. Write a program to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem.
10. Solve the Monkey Banana Problem using a search or planning algorithm.
11. Implement the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm for optimizing the search in a minimax game tree.
12. Solve the 8-Queens Problem using a search algorithm. Implement a program to find a
placement of eight queens on a chessboard such that no two queens attack each other
